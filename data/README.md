# Test Information
These tests were run to compare how my speeds changed as I incrementally
upgraded the equipment in my desktop. Below are descriptions of the equipment
changes.

## 00-no-upgrades.csv
This was the initial test, the control. My computer was plugged into an old
router that we were using as a switch, and the router was plugged into a wall
jack that led back to the main router. The router we were using as a switch was
one of those "family" routers that filter content and I was locked out of the
admin panel so I couldn't properly configure it.

## 01-new-switch.csv
Replaced the router that was acting as a switch with a TP-Link TL-SG105, a
5-port gigabit switch.
